# Custom WeakAura Sound Guide

1. Download the ```Thundering_5s_warning.zip``` file by clicking on the download button on [this page.](https://github.com/critzd/weakauras/blob/main/thundering/media/ThunderingCustomSounds.zip)
2. Extract it to your WoW Retail addons folder: ```C:\...\...\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns``` If you imported the WeakAura before extracting the file, restart your game.
3. Import the weakaura (if you haven't already). It will now work with the custom sound!
